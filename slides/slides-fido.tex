\begin{frame}{認証とは}
\begin{block}{認証}
 「何らかの手段」で\alert{対象の正当性を確認する}こと。
\end{block}
\begin{itemize}
 \item メッセージの正当性を確認 $\Rightarrow$ メッセージ認証
 \item サービス利用ユーザの正当性を確認 $\Rightarrow$ ユーザ認証
 \item etc.
\end{itemize}

\vspace{2ex}

※このスライドで単純に「認証」と呼んだときは、\ul{認証対象を「正規ユーザ本人」としたユーザ認証・本人認証を指す}こととする。
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{パスワード認証}
\begin{itemize}
\item サービスの利用者の識別子 (ID) と対応するパスワードをサービス事業者に登録、サービス利用時に利用者が自分のIDとパスワードを入力する。
\item パスワードは個人の記憶にのみ存在するため、\alert{パスワードを知っている人はそのサービスに登録してる本人と同一人物}と考えることができる。
\end{itemize}

おそらく、誰にとっても最も馴染み深い認証方式！
